    "# Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting is the process of placing elements from a collection in some kind of order. For example, a list of words could be sorted alphabetically or by length. A list of cities could be sorted by population, by area, or by zip code. We have already seen a number of algorithms that were able to benefit from having a sorted list (recall the final anagram example and the binary search).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many sorting algorithms that have been developed and analyzed. This suggests that sorting is an important area of study in computer science. Sorting a large number of items can take a substantial amount of computing resources. Like searching, the efficiency of a sorting algorithm is related to the number of items being processed. For small collections, a complex sorting method may be more trouble than it is worth. The overhead may be too high. On the other hand, for larger collections, we want to take advantage of as many improvements as possible. In this section we will discuss several sorting techniques and compare them with respect to their running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into specific algorithms, we should think about the operations that can be used to analyze a sorting process. First, it will be necessary to compare two values to see which is smaller (or larger). In order to sort a collection, it will be necessary to have some systematic way to compare values to see if they are out of order. The total number of comparisons will be the most common way to measure a sort procedure. Second, when values are not in the correct position with respect to one another, it may be necessary to exchange them. This exchange is a costly operation and the total number of exchanges will also be important for evaluating the overall efficiency of the algorithm."

However, because the bubble sort makes passes through the entire unsorted portion of the list, it has the capability to do something most sorting algorithms cannot. In particular, if during a pass there are no exchanges, then we know that the list must be sorted. A bubble sort can be modified to stop early if it finds that the list has become sorted. This means that for lists that require just a few passes, a bubble sort may have an advantage in that it will recognize the sorted list and stop. The following code shows this modification, which is often referred to as the **short bubble**."

    "Once the mergeSort function is invoked on the left half and the right half (lines 8–9), it is assumed they are sorted. The rest of the function (lines 11–31) is responsible for merging the two smaller sorted lists into a larger sorted list. Notice that the merge operation places the items back into the original list (`alist`) one at a time by repeatedly taking the smallest item from the sorted lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mergeSort` function has been augmented with a `print` statement (line 2) to show the contents of the list being sorted at the start of each invocation. There is also a `print` statement (line 32) to show the merging process. The transcript shows the result of executing the function on our example list. Note that the list with 44, 55, and 20 will not divide evenly. The first split gives [44] and the second gives [55,20]. It is easy to see how the splitting process eventually yields a list that can be immediately merged with other sorted lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to analyze the `mergeSort` function, we need to consider the two distinct processes that make up its implementation. First, the list is split into halves. We already computed (in a binary search) that we can divide a list in half logn times where $n$ is the length of the list. The second process is the merge. Each item in the list will eventually be processed and placed on the sorted list. So the merge operation which results in a list of size $n$ requires $n$ operations. The result of this analysis is that $logn$ splits, each of which costs $n$ for a total of $nlogn$ operations. Thus a merge sort is an $O(nlogn)$ algorithm.\n",

    "Recall that the slicing operator is $O(k)$ where $k$ is the size of the slice. In order to guarantee that `mergeSort` will be $O(nlogn)$ we will need to remove the slice operator. Again, this is possible if we simply pass the starting and ending indices along with the list when we make the recursive call. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to notice that the `mergeSort` function requires extra space to hold the two halves as they are extracted with the slicing operations. This additional space can be a critical factor if the list is large and can make this sort problematic when working on large data sets."

The actual position where the pivot value belongs in the final sorted list, commonly called the **split point**, will be used to divide the list for subsequent calls to the quick sort.\n",

Since we have looked at this example a few times already, we know that 54 will eventually end up in the position currently holding 31. The **partition** process will happen next.

The Figure below shows this process as we locate the position of 54.\n",

Now we can exchange these two items and then repeat the process again.\n",

In addition, all the items to the left of the split point are less than the pivot value, and all the items to the right of the split point are greater than the pivot value The list can now be divided at the split point and the quick sort can be invoked recursively on the two halves\n",

    "Note that the performance of quicksort is only $O(n log n)$ if the values in the array occur in completely random order. If an array is already sorted, quicksort has time complexity $O(n^2)$ if we would always pick the first value of the array as the pivot like in the implementation above. Why? Because, depending on whether the array is sorted in ascending or descending order, the left or the right subarray in the recursive function will always be empty. Thus, if we have n elements in an array, our call stack will have a depth of n, thus $O(n*n) = O(n^2)$. However, if we always divide the array in half, the call stack will only have depth $log n$, thus $O(n log n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we know that our arrays are not always in random order, it is recommended to implement quicksort so that it picks a random element as the pivot and not always strictly the first number in that array.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the `quickSort` function, note that for a list of length $n$, if the partition always occurs in the middle of the list, there will again be logn divisions. In order to find the split point, each of the n items needs to be checked against the pivot value. The result is $nlogn$. In addition, there is no need for additional memory as in the merge sort process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, in the worst case, the split points may not be in the middle and can be very skewed to the left or the right, leaving a very uneven division. In this case, sorting a list of $n$ items divides into sorting a list of 0 items and a list of n−1 items. Then sorting a list of $n−1$ divides into a list of size $0$ and a list of size $n−2$, and so on. The result is an $O(n^2)$ sort with all of the overhead that recursion requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "We mentioned earlier that there are different ways to choose the pivot value. In particular, we can attempt to alleviate some of the potential for an uneven division by using a technique called **median of three**. To choose the pivot value, we will consider the first, the middle, and the last element in the list. In our example, those are 54, 77, and 20. Now pick the median value, in our case 54, and use it for the pivot value (of course, that was the pivot value we used originally). The idea is that in the case where the the first item in the list does not belong toward the middle of the list, the median of three will choose a better “middle” value. This will be particularly useful when the original list is somewhat sorted to begin with. "
