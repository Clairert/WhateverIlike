    "Now that we have already studied linear data structures like stacks and queues and have some experience with recursion, we will look at a common non-linear data structure called the tree. Trees are used in many areas of computer science, including operating systems, graphics, database systems, and computer networking. Tree data structures have many things in common with their botanical cousins. A tree data structure has a root, branches, and leaves. The difference between a tree in nature and a tree in computer science is that a tree data structure has its root at the top and its leafs on the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin our study of tree data structures, let’s look at a few common examples. Our first example of a tree is a classification tree from biology. The Figure below shows an example of the biological classification of some animals. From this simple example, we can learn about several properties of trees. The first property this example demonstrates is that trees are hierarchical. By hierarchical, we mean that trees are structured in layers with the more general things near the top and the more specific things near the bottom. The top of the hierarchy is the Kingdom, the next layer of the tree (the “children” of the layer above) is the Phylum, then the Class, and so on. However, no matter how deep we go in the classification tree, all the organisms are still animals.\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Notice that you can start at the top of the tree and follow a path made of circles and arrows all the way to the bottom. At each level of the tree we might ask ourselves a question and then follow the path that agrees with our answer. For example we might ask, “Is this animal a Chordate or an Arthropod?” If the answer is “Chordate” then we follow that path and ask, “Is this Chordate a Mammal?” \n",
    "\n",
    "A second property of trees is that all of the children of one node are independent of the children of another node. For example, the Genus Felis has the children Domestica and Leo. The Genus Musca also has a child named Domestica, but it is a different node and is independent of the Domestica child of Felis. This means that we can change the node that is the child of Musca without affecting the child of Felis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third property is that each leaf node is unique. We can specify a path from the root of the tree to a leaf that uniquely identifies each species in the animal kingdom; for example: `Animalia → Chordate → Mammal → Carnivora → Felidae → Felis → Domestica`."

    "![](./images/t2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The file system tree has much in common with the biological classification tree. You can follow a path from the root to any directory. That path will uniquely identify that subdirectory (and all the files in it). Another important property of trees, derived from their hierarchical nature, is that you can move entire sections of a tree (called a subtree) to a different position in the tree without affecting the lower levels of the hierarchy. For example, we could take the entire subtree starting with `/etc/`, detach `etc/` from the root and reattach it under `usr/`. This would change the unique pathname to `httpd` from `/etc/httpd` to `/usr/etc/httpd`, but would not affect the contents or any children of the `httpd` directory."

If you check, you will see that this nesting property is true at all levels of the tree."

    "## Vocabulary and definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have looked at examples of trees, we will formally define a tree and its components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Node**: A node is a fundamental part of a tree. It can have a name, which we call the “key.” A node may also have additional information. We call this additional information the “payload.” While the payload information is not central to many tree algorithms, it is often critical in applications that make use of trees.\n",
    "- **Edge**: An edge is another fundamental part of a tree. An edge connects two nodes to show that there is a relationship between them. Every node (except the root) is connected by exactly one incoming edge from another node. Each node may have several outgoing edges.\n",
    "- **Root**: The root of the tree is the only node in the tree that has no incoming edges. In a computer file system, `/` is the root of the tree.\n",
    "- **Path**: A path is an ordered list of nodes that are connected by edges. For example, Mammal → Carnivora → Felidae → Felis → Domestica is a path.\n",
    "- **Children**: The set of nodes `c` that have incoming edges from the same node to are said to be the children of that node. In the file system Figure, nodes `log/`, `spool/`, and `yp/` are the children of node `var/`.\n",
    "- **Parent**: A node is the parent of all the nodes it connects to with outgoing edges. In the file system Figure the node `var/` is the parent of nodes `log/`, `spool/`, and `yp/`.\n",
    "- **Sibling**: Nodes in the tree that are children of the same parent are said to be siblings. The nodes `etc/` and `usr/` are siblings in the filesystem tree.\n",
    "- **Subtree**: A subtree is a set of nodes and edges comprised of a parent and all the descendants of that parent.\n",
    "- **Leaf Node**: A leaf node is a node that has no children. In their biological classification of animals three example, Human and Chimpanzee are leaf nodes.\n",
    "- **Level**: The level of a node n is the number of edges on the path from the root node to n. For example, the level of the Felis node in the animals classification tree is five. By definition, the level of the root node is zero.\n",
    "- **Height**: The height of a tree is equal to the maximum level of any node in the tree. The height of the tree in the file system Figure is two.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the basic vocabulary now defined, we can move on to a formal definition of a tree. In fact, we will provide two definitions of a tree. One definition involves nodes and edges. The second definition, which will prove to be very useful, is a recursive definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 1**: A tree consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges that connect pairs of nodes. A tree has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One node of the tree is designated as the root node.\n",
    "- Every node n, except the root node, is connected by an edge from exactly one other node p, where p is the parent of n.\n",
    "- A unique path traverses from the root to each node.\n",
    "- If each node in the tree has a maximum of two children, we say that the tree is a **binary tree**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next Figure illustrates a tree that fits definition 1. The arrowheads on the edges indicate the direction of the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/t4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2**: A tree is either empty or consists of a root and zero or more subtrees, each of which is also a tree. The root of each subtree is connected to the root of the parent tree by an edge. The next Figure illustrates this recursive definition of a tree. Using the recursive definition of a tree, we know that the tree in the Figure has at least four nodes, since each of the triangles representing a subtree must have a root. It may have many more nodes than that, but we do not know unless we look deeper into the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/t5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key decision in implementing a tree is choosing a good internal storage technique. Python allows us two very interesting possibilities, we will examine both before choosing one. The first technique we will call **list of lists**, the second technique we will call **nodes and references**."

    "## List of Lists Representation of a tree\n",
    "\n",
    "In a tree represented by a list of lists, we will begin with Python’s list data structure and write the functions necessary to create a tree data structure. Although writing the interface as a set of operations on a list is a bit different from the other abstract data types we have implemented, it is interesting to do so because it provides us with a simple recursive data structure that we can look at and examine directly. In a list of lists tree, we will store the value of the root node as the first element of the list. The second element of the list will itself be a list that represents the left subtree. The third element of the list will be another list that represents the right subtree. To illustrate this storage technique, let’s look at an example. The Figure shows a simple tree and below is the corresponding list implementation.\n",

Using nodes and references to represent the tree in the previous Figure, we would create six instances of the BinaryTree class.\n",
