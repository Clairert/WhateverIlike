    "\n",
    "To analyze searching algorithms, we need to decide on a basic unit of computation. Recall that this is typically the common step that must be repeated in order to solve the problem. For searching, it makes sense to count the number of comparisons performed. Each comparison may or may not discover the item we are looking for. In addition, we make another assumption here. The list of items is not ordered in any way. The items have been placed randomly into the list. In other words, the probability that the item we are looking for is in any particular position is exactly the same for each position of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the item is not in the list, the only way to know it is to compare it against every item present. If there are `n` items, then the sequential search requires `n` comparisons to discover that the item is not there. In the case where the item is in the list, the analysis is not so straightforward. There are actually three different scenarios that can occur. In the best case we will find the item in the first place we look, at the beginning of the list. We will need only one comparison. In the worst case, we will not discover the item until the very last comparison, the nth comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the average case? On average, we will find the item about halfway into the list; that is, we will compare against $\\frac{n}{2}$ items. Recall, however, that as `n` gets large, the coefficients, no matter what they are, become insignificant in our approximation, so the complexity of the sequential search, is $O(n)$. The next Table summarizes these results.\n",

    "Assume that the list of items was constructed so that the items were in ascending order, from low to high. If the item we are looking for is present in the list, the chance of it being in any one of the n positions is still the same as before. We will still have the same number of comparisons to find the item. However, if the item is not present there is a slight advantage. The Figure below shows this process as the algorithm looks for the item 50. Notice that items are still compared in sequence until 54. At this point, however, we know something extra. Not only is 54 not the item we are looking for, but no other elements beyond 54 can work either since the list is sorted. In this case, the algorithm does not have to continue looking through all of the items to report that the item was not found. It can stop immediately.\n",

We can implement a hash table by using a list with each element initialized to the special Python value `None`. The next Figure shows a hash table of size $m=11$. In other words, there are m slots in the table, named 0 through 10.\n",

Assume that we have the set of integer items $54, 26, 93, 17, 77,$ and $31$. Our first hash function, sometimes referred to as the “remainder method,” simply takes an item and divides it by the table size, returning the remainder as its hash value $(h(item)=item\\%11)$. The next Table gives all of the hash values for our example items. Note that this remainder method (modulo arithmetic) will typically be present in some form in all hash functions, since the result must be in the range of slot names.\n",

According to the hash function, two or more items would need to be in the same slot. This is referred to as a **collision** (it may also be called a “clash”).

If we know the items and the collection will never change, then it is possible to construct a perfect hash function. Unfortunately, given an arbitrary collection of items, there is no systematic way to construct a perfect hash function. Luckily, we do not need the hash function to be perfect to still gain performance efficiency.\n",

    "One way to always have a perfect hash function is to increase the size of the hash table so that each possible value in the item range can be accommodated. This guarantees that each item will have a unique slot. Although this is practical for small numbers of items, it is not feasible when the number of possible items is large. For example, if the items were nine-digit Social Security numbers, this method would require almost one billion slots. If we only want to store data for a class of 25 students, we will be wasting an enormous amount of memory.\n",

    "The **folding** **method** for constructing hash functions begins by dividing the item into equal-size pieces (the last piece may not be of equal size). These pieces are then added together to give the resulting hash value. For example, if our item was the phone number $436-555-4601$, we would take the digits and divide them into groups of 2 (43,65,55,46,01). After the addition, $43+65+55+46+01$, we get $210$. If we assume our hash table has 11 slots, then we need to perform the extra step of dividing by 11 and keeping the remainder. In this case $210 \\% 11$ is 1, so the phone number 436-555-4601 hashes to slot 1. Some folding methods go one step further and reverse every other piece before the addition. For the above example, we get $43+56+55+64+01=219$ which gives $219 \\% 11=10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another numerical technique for constructing a hash function is called the **mid-square method**. We first square the item, and then extract some portion of the resulting digits. For example, if the item were 44, we would first compute $44^2=1,936$. By extracting the middle two digits, 93, and performing the remainder step, we get 5 ($93 \n",

    "The next Figure shows our original hash table contents for list (54,26,93,17,77,31):\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/h7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next Figure shows an extended set of integer items under the simple remainder method hash function (54,26,93,17,77,31,44,55,20). When we attempt to place 44 into slot 0, a collision occurs. Under linear probing, we look sequentially, slot by slot, until we find an open position. In this case, we find slot 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, 55 should go in slot 0 but must be placed in slot 2 since it is the next open position. The final value of 20 hashes to slot 9. Since slot 9 is full, we begin to do linear probing. We visit slots 10, 0, 1, and 2, and finally find an empty slot at position 3\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/h8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have built a hash table using open addressing and linear probing, it is essential that we utilize the same methods to search for items. Assume we want to look up the item 93. When we compute the hash value, we get 5. Looking in slot 5 reveals 93, and we can return True. What if we are looking for 20? Now the hash value is 9, and slot 9 is currently holding 31. We cannot simply return False since we know that there could have been collisions. We are now forced to do a sequential search, starting at position 10, looking until either we find the item 20 or we find an empty slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage to linear probing is the tendency for clustering; items become clustered in the table. This means that if many collisions occur at the same hash value, a number of surrounding slots will be filled by the linear probing resolution. This will have an impact on other items that are being inserted, as we saw when we tried to add the item 20 above. A cluster of values hashing to 0 had to be skipped to finally find an open position. This cluster is shown in below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/h9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to deal with clustering is to extend the linear probing technique so that instead of looking sequentially for the next open slot, we skip slots, thereby more evenly distributing the items that have caused collisions. This will potentially reduce the clustering that occurs. The Figure below shows the items when collision resolution is done with a “plus 3” probe. This means that once a collision occurs, we will look at every third slot until we find one that is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/h10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The general name for this process of looking for another slot after a collision is `rehashing`. With simple linear probing, the rehash function is $newhashvalue=rehash(oldhashvalue)$ where $rehash(pos)=(pos+1)%sizeoftable$. The “plus 3” rehash can be defined as $rehash(pos)=(pos+3)%sizeoftable$. In general, $rehash(pos)=(pos+skip)%sizeoftable$. It is important to note that the size of the “skip” must be such that all the slots in the table will eventually be visited. Otherwise, part of the table will be unused. To ensure this, it is often suggested that the table size be a prime number. This is the reason we have been using 11 in our examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variation of the linear probing idea is called **quadratic probing**. Instead of using a constant “skip” value, we use a rehash function that increments the hash value by 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. This means that if the first hash value is h, the successive values are $h+1, h+4, h+9, h+16$, and so on. In other words, quadratic probing uses a skip consisting of successive perfect squares. Figure 11 shows our example values after they are placed using this technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative method for handling the collision problem is to allow each slot to hold a reference to a collection (or chain) of items. **Chaining** allows many items to exist at the same location in the hash table. When collisions happen, the item is still placed in the proper slot of the hash table. As more and more items hash to the same location, the difficulty of searching for the item in the collection increases. The Figure below shows the items as they are added to a hash table that uses chaining to resolve collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/c.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to search for an item, we use the hash function to generate the slot where it should reside. Since each slot holds a collection, we use a searching technique to decide whether the item is present. The advantage is that on the average there are likely to be many fewer items in each slot, so the search is perhaps more efficient. "

    "## Implementing the `Map` Abstract Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful Python collections is the dictionary. Recall that a dictionary is an associative data type where you can store key–data pairs. The key is used to look up the associated data value. We often refer to this idea as a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The map abstract data type is defined as follows. The structure is an unordered collection of associations between a key and a data value. The keys in a map are all unique so that there is a one-to-one relationship between a key and a value. The operations are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Map()` Create a new, empty map. It returns an empty map collection.\n",
    "- `put(key,val)` Add a new key-value pair to the map. If the key is already in the map then replace the old value with the new value.\n",
    "- `get(key)` Given a key, return the value stored in the map or `None` otherwise.\n",
    "- `del` Delete the key-value pair from the map using a statement of the form `del map[key]`.\n",
    "- `len()` Return the number of key-value pairs stored in the map.\n",
    "- `in` Return `True` for a statement of the form `key in map`, if the given key is in the map, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great benefits of a dictionary is the fact that given a key, we can look up the associated data value very quickly. In order to provide this fast look up capability, we need an implementation that supports an efficient search. We could use a list with sequential or binary search but it would be even better to use a hash table as described above since looking up an item in a hash table can approach $O(1)$ performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code Listing below we use two lists to create a `HashTable` class that implements the Map abstract data type. One list, called `slots`, will hold the key items and a parallel list, called `data`, will hold the data values. When we look up a key, the corresponding position in the data list will hold the associated data value. We will treat the key list as a hash table using the ideas presented earlier. Note that the initial size for the hash table has been chosen to be 11. Although this is arbitrary, it is important that the size be a prime number so that the collision resolution algorithm can be as efficient as possible."

    "## Analysis of Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "We stated earlier that in the best case hashing would provide a $O(1)$, constant time search technique. However, due to collisions, the number of comparisons is typically not so simple. Even though a complete analysis of hashing is beyond the scope of this text, we can state some well-known results that approximate the number of comparisons necessary to search for an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important piece of information we need to analyze the use of a hash table is the load factor, $\\lambda$. Conceptually, if $\\lambda$ is small, then there is a lower chance of collisions, meaning that items are more likely to be in the slots where they belong. If $\\lambda$ is large, meaning that the table is filling up, then there are more and more collisions. This means that collision resolution is more difficult, requiring more comparisons to find an empty slot. With chaining, increased collisions means an increased number of items on each chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we will have a result for both a successful and an unsuccessful search. For a successful search using open addressing with linear probing, the average number of comparisons is approximately $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda}\\right)$ and an unsuccessful search gives $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda}\\right)^2\\right)$.  If we are using chaining, the average number of comparisons is $1 + \\frac {\\lambda}{2}$ for the successful case, and simply $\\lambda$ comparisons if the search is unsuccessful."
