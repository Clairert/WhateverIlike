    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will study graphs. Graphs are a more general structure than the trees we studied in the last chapter; in fact you can think of a tree as a special kind of graph. Graphs can be used to represent many interesting things about our world, including systems of roads, airline flights from city to city, how the Internet is connected, or even the sequence of classes you must take to complete a a Bachelor degree in IT. We will see in this chapter that once we have a good representation for a problem, we can use some standard graph algorithms to solve what otherwise might seem to be a very difficult problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is relatively easy for humans to look at a road map and understand the relationships between different places, a computer has no such knowledge. However, we can also think of a road map as a graph. When we do so we can have our computer do interesting things for us. If you have ever used one of the Internet map sites, you know that a computer can find the shortest, quickest, or easiest path from one place to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph can be used to represent the prerequisites and other interdependencies among courses you must take in order to get a degree. The next Figure shows a graph representing the courses and the order in which they must be taken to advance towards your bachelor degree in IT at Otago Polytechnic.\n",

    "## Vocabulary and definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have looked at some examples of graphs, we will more formally define a graph and its components. We already know some of these terms from our discussion of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vertex**\n",
    "A vertex (also called a “node”) is a fundamental part of a graph. It can have a name, which we will call the “key.” A vertex may also have additional information. We will call this additional information the “payload.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge**\n",
    "An edge (also called an “arc”) is another fundamental part of a graph. An edge connects two vertices to show that there is a relationship between them. Edges may be one-way or two-way. If the edges in a graph are all one-way, we say that the graph is a **directed graph**, or a **digraph**. The courses prerequisites graph shown above is clearly a digraph since you must take some classes before others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight**\n",
    "Edges may be weighted to show that there is a cost to go from one vertex to another. For example, in a graph of roads that \n",
    "connect one city to another, the weight on the edge might represent the distance between the two cities."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},

    "With those definitions in hand we can formally define a graph. A graph can be represented by $G$ where $G=(V,E)$. For the graph $G$, $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a set of edges. Each edge is a tuple $(v,w)$ where $v,w \\in V$. We can add a third component to the edge tuple to represent a weight. A subgraph $s$ is a set of edges $e$ and vertices $v$ such that $e \\subset E$ and $v \\subset V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next Figure shows another example of a simple weighted digraph. Formally we can represent this graph as the set of six vertices:\n",

    "The example graph in the previous Figure helps illustrate two other key graph terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path**\n",
    "A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. Formally we would define a path as $w_1,w_2,...,w_n$ such that $(w_i,w_{i+1})\\in E$ for all $1\\leq i \\leq n−1$. The unweighted path length is the number of edges in the path, specifically $n−1$. The weighted path length is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the path. For example, in the previous Figure the path from $V3$ to $V1$ is the sequence of vertices $(V3,V4,V0,V1)$. The edges are ${(v3,v4,7),(v4,v0,1),(v0,v1,5)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cycle**\n",
    "A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. For example, in the previous Figure the path $(V5,V2,V3,V5)$ is a cycle. A graph with no cycles is called an **acyclic graph**. A directed graph with no cycles is called a **directed acyclic graph** or a **DAG**. We will see that we can solve several important problems if the problem can be represented as a DAG."

    "## The Graph Abstract Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph abstract data type (ADT) is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Graph()` creates a new, empty graph.\n",
    "- `addVertex(vert)` adds an instance of `Vertex` to the graph.\n",
    "- `addEdge(fromVert, toVert)` Adds a new, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.\n",
    "- `addEdge(fromVert, toVert, weight)` Adds a new, weighted, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.\n",
    "- `getVertex(vertKey)` finds the vertex in the graph named `vertKey`.\n",
    "- `getVertices()` returns the list of all vertices in the graph.\n",
    "- `in` returns `True` for a statement of the form `vertex in graph`, if the given vertex is in the graph, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning with the formal definition for a graph there are several ways we can implement the graph ADT in Python. We will see that there are trade-offs in using different representations to implement the ADT described above. There are two well-known implementations of a graph, the **adjacency matrix** and the **adjacency list**. We will explain both of these options, and then implement one as a Python class."

    "## An adjacency matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to implement a graph is to use a two-dimensional matrix. In this matrix implementation, each of the rows and columns represent a vertex in the graph. The value that is stored in the cell at the intersection of row $v$ and column $w$ indicates if there is an edge from vertex $v$ to vertex $w$. When two vertices are connected by an edge, we say that they are **adjacent**. The next Figure illustrates the adjacency matrix for the graph in the Figure above. A value in a cell represents the weight of the edge from vertex $v$ to vertex $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/am.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of the adjacency matrix is that it is simple, and for small graphs it is easy to see which nodes are connected to other nodes. However, notice that most of the cells in the matrix are empty. Because most of the cells are empty we say that this matrix is “sparse.” A matrix is not a very efficient way to store sparse data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The adjacency matrix is a good implementation for a graph when the number of edges is large. But what do we mean by large? How many edges would be needed to fill the matrix? Since there is one row and one column for every vertex in the graph, the number of edges required to fill the matrix is $|V|^2$. A matrix is full when every vertex is connected to every other vertex. There are few real problems that approach this sort of connectivity. The problems we will look at in this chapter all involve graphs that are sparsely connected."

In an adjacency list implementation we keep a master list of all the vertices in the Graph object and then each vertex object in the graph maintains a list of the other vertices that it is connected to. In our implementation of the `Vertex` class we will use a dictionary rather than a list where the dictionary keys are the vertices, and the values are the weights. The next Figure illustrates the adjacency list representation for the graph in the second Figure of this practical.\n",

The listing below shows the code for the `Vertex` class. The constructor simply initializes the `id`, which will typically be a string, and the `connectedTo` dictionary. The `addNeighbor` method is used to add a connection from this vertex to another. The `getConnections` method returns all of the vertices in the adjacency list, as represented by the `connectedTo` instance variable. The `getWeight` method returns the weight of the edge from this vertex to the vertex passed as a parameter."

What we would like is to have an edge from one word to another if the two words are only different by a single letter. If we can create such a graph, then any path from one word to another is a solution to the word ladder puzzle.

    "We could use several different approaches to create the graph we need to solve this problem. Let’s start with the assumption that we have a list of words that are all the same length. As a starting point, we can create a vertex in the graph for every word in the list. To figure out how to connect the words, we could compare each word in the list with every other. When we compare a pair of words we compute how many letters are different. If the two words in question are different by only one letter, we can create an edge between them in the graph. For a small set of words that approach would work fine; however let’s suppose we have a list of 5,110 words. Roughly speaking, comparing one word to every other word on the list is an $O(n^2)$ algorithm. For 5,110 words, $n^2$ is more than 26 million comparisons.\n",

    "We can do much better by using the following approach. Suppose that we have a huge number of buckets, each of them with a four-letter word on the outside, except that one of the letters in the label has been replaced by an underscore. For example, in the next Figure, we have a bucket labeled `Pop_`. As we process each word in our list we compare the word with each bucket, using the character `_` as a wildcard, so both `Pope` and `Pops` would match `Pop_`. Every time we find a matching bucket, we put our word in that bucket. Once we have all the words in the appropriate buckets we know that all the words in the bucket must be connected. The running time of this alternative algorithm is $O(n)$.\n",

The value stored for that key is a list of words. Once we have the dictionary built we can create the graph. We start our graph by creating a vertex for each word in the graph. Then we create edges between all the vertices we find for words found under the same key in the dictionary (i.e. bucket). The following Listing shows the Python code required to build the graph."

The graph constructed by the `buildGraph` function has exactly 53,286 edges, so the matrix would have only 0.20% of the cells filled! That is a very sparse matrix indeed."

    "## Implementing Breadth First Search\n",
    "\n",
    "With the graph constructed we can now turn our attention to the algorithm we will use to find the shortest solution to the word ladder problem. The graph algorithm we are going to use is called the “breadth first search” algorithm. **Breadth first search (BFS)** is one of the easiest algorithms for searching a graph. It also serves as a prototype for several other important graph algorithms that we will study later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a graph $G$ and a starting vertex `s`, a breadth first search proceeds by exploring edges in the graph to find all the vertices in $G$ for which there is a path from $s$. The remarkable thing about a breadth first search is that it finds all the vertices that are a distance $k$ from $s$ before it finds any vertices that are a distance $k+1$. One good way to visualize what the breadth first search algorithm does is to imagine that it is building a tree, one level of the tree at a time. A breadth first search adds all children of the starting vertex before it begins to discover any of the grandchildren.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep track of its progress, BFS colors each of the vertices white, gray, or black. All the vertices are initialized to white when they are constructed. A white vertex is an undiscovered vertex. When a vertex is initially discovered it is colored gray, and when BFS has completely explored a vertex it is colored black. This means that once a vertex is colored black, it has no white vertices adjacent to it. A gray node, on the other hand, may have some white vertices adjacent to it, indicating that there are still additional vertices to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "The breadth first search algorithm shown in the code Listing below uses the adjacency list graph representation we developed earlier. In addition it uses a `Queue`, a crucial point as we will see, to decide which vertex to explore next.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the BFS algorithm uses an extended version of the `Vertex` class. This new vertex class adds three new instance variables: `distance`, `predecessor`, and `color`. Each of these instance variables also has the appropriate getter and setter methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "BFS begins at the starting vertex `s` and colors `start` gray to show that it is currently being explored. Two other values, the distance and the predecessor, are initialized to 0 and `None` respectively for the starting vertex. Finally, `start` is placed on a `Queue`. The next step is to begin to systematically explore vertices at the front of the queue. We explore each new node at the front of the queue by iterating over its adjacency list. As each node on the adjacency list is examined its color is checked. If it is white, the vertex is unexplored, and four things happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The new, unexplored vertex `nbr`, is colored gray.\n",
    "2. The predecessor of `nbr` is set to the current node `currentVert`\n",
    "3. The distance to `nbr` is set to the distance to `currentVert + 1`\n",
    "4. `nbr` is added to the end of a queue. Adding `nbr` to the end of the queue effectively schedules this node for further exploration, but not until all the other vertices on the adjacency list of `currentVert` have been explored."

    "Let us analyze the run time performance of the breadth first search algorithm. The first thing to observe is that the while loop in `bfs()` is executed, at most, one time for each vertex in the graph $|V|$. You can see that this is true because a vertex must be white before it can be examined and added to the queue. This gives us $O(V)$ for the while loop. The for loop, which is nested inside the while is executed at most once for each edge in the graph, $|E|$. The reason is that every vertex is dequeued at most once and we examine an edge from node `u` to node `v` only when node `u` is dequeued. This gives us $O(E)$ for the for loop. Combining the two loops gives us $O(V \\times E)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course doing the breadth first search is only part of the task. Following the links from the starting node to the goal node is the other part of the task. The worst case for this would be if the graph was a single long chain. In this case traversing through all of the vertices would be $O(V)$. The normal case is going to be some fraction of $|V|$ but we would still write $O(V)$."
